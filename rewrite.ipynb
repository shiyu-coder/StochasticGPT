Finally, it outlines the paper's contribution by stating that the approach taken to address the large gaps in the air quality data will be described.

      "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 91\\% of the world's population reside in conditions where WHO's air quality guidelines levels were not met \\cite{organizacion2021global}. This report from 2016 also indicated that ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide. The research emphasized that implementing policies and investments to support cleaner transport, energy-efficient homes, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management could significantly reduce outdoor air pollution. Another report estimates that air pollution globally accounts for approximately seven million premature deaths annually \\cite{Gar21}, with the majority of these deaths being attributed to outdoor air pollution and the remainder largely due to poor indoor air quality from cooking practices. While most of these deaths occur in developing countries, with China and India contributing to about 50\\%, developed nations are not exempt from the detrimental effects of air pollution.\n",
      "In this research, we primarily examine the modelling of particulate matter concentrations—tiny particles in the air produced by both natural processes and human activities. These particles are typically classified by their diameter; fine particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 $\\mu$m are denoted as \"PM2.5,\" and coarse particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 $\\mu$m are labeled as \"PM10\".\n",

Participants were tasked with retrieving this data from various online repositories for subsequent local analysis.\n",
      "Data gaps are a prevalent issue in air quality datasets, with this challenge being more pronounced in data collected from less affluent or developing regions \\cite{PINDER2019116794, Falge2001, Hui2004, Moffat2007, Kim2020}.
